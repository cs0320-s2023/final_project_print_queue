            ! The BDW working space is open 24/7, but only monitors have keys to

            . We ask you to respect the time of other users when the space is in
            heavy demand. During busy parts of the semester, 3D Printing jobs
            are capped 6 hours before 10 pm, and 12 hours after 10 pm until
            closing. If you start a print before 2 pm on a day that the BDW is
            open, your print will be cancelled by the monitors on opening shift.
